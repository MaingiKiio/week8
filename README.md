# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted countries worldwide, prompting urgent responses in healthcare, policy, and vaccination. In this data analysis project, we examine global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data).

The primary objective is to explore how the pandemic evolved over time in selected countries â€” **Kenya**, **United States**, and **India** â€” and to gain insights into their responses and outcomes.

### Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- Compare metrics across countries.
- Visualize trends using graphs and charts.
- Summarize findings with data-driven insights.

## Conclusion & Key Insights

After analyzing COVID-19 data for Kenya, the United States, and India, we derived the following insights:

### ðŸ“Œ Insight 1: The United States had the highest total vaccination count.
The US started early and ramped up quickly, surpassing both Kenya and India in terms of total and per capita vaccinations.

### ðŸ“Œ Insight 2: India faced the most significant spike in daily new cases in mid-2021.
This period coincides with the spread of the Delta variant, leading to a huge surge in infections and fatalities.

### ðŸ“Œ Insight 3: Kenyaâ€™s vaccination progress was slower but gradually improved.
Although Kenya began vaccinations later, consistent efforts have led to increased coverage over time.

### ðŸ“Œ Insight 4: Death rates remained relatively low in Kenya compared to India and the US.
This might be influenced by demographic factors such as a younger population or underreporting.

## Final Thoughts

This analysis highlights the importance of timely vaccination, real-time data collection, and regional-specific responses during global health crises. Data science tools such as Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making and improve public health outcomes.
