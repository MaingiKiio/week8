# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted countries worldwide, prompting urgent responses in healthcare, policy, and vaccination. In this data analysis project, we examine global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data).

The primary objective is to explore how the pandemic evolved over time in selected countries ‚Äî **Kenya**, **United States**, and **India** ‚Äî and to gain insights into their responses and outcomes.

### Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
- Compare metrics across countries.
- Visualize trends using graphs and charts.
- Summarize findings with data-driven insights.

## Conclusion & Key Insights

After analyzing COVID-19 data for Kenya, the United States, and India, we derived the following insights:

### üìå Insight 1: The United States had the highest total vaccination count.
The US started early and ramped up quickly, surpassing both Kenya and India in terms of total and per capita vaccinations.

### üìå Insight 2: India faced the most significant spike in daily new cases in mid-2021.
This period coincides with the spread of the Delta variant, leading to a huge surge in infections and fatalities.

### üìå Insight 3: Kenya‚Äôs vaccination progress was slower but gradually improved.
Although Kenya began vaccinations later, consistent efforts have led to increased coverage over time.

### üìå Insight 4: Death rates remained relatively low in Kenya compared to India and the US.
This might be influenced by demographic factors such as a younger population or underreporting.

## Final Thoughts

This analysis highlights the importance of timely vaccination, real-time data collection, and regional-specific responses during global health crises. Data science tools such as Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making and improve public health outcomes.

A data analysis project using real-world COVID-19 data to explore global trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and narrative insights.

# How to Use This COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Notebook

This notebook guides you through analyzing global COVID-19 data to explore cases, deaths, and vaccination trends. Follow these steps to understand and use the notebook effectively:

---

### 1. Load the Data
- Load the COVID-19 dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) using pandas.
- This dataset contains global daily data on cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

### 2. Explore and Clean the Data
- Inspect the dataset structure, columns, and missing values.
- Filter data for selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).
- Convert date columns to datetime format and handle missing values.

### 3. Analyze Time Trends
- Plot total and new COVID-19 cases and deaths over time for each country.
- Calculate additional metrics such as death rates for deeper insights.

### 4. Visualize Vaccination Progress
- Plot cumulative vaccinations and vaccination rates over time.
- Compare vaccination rollouts across countries.

### 5. Compare Across Countries
- Overlay plots to directly compare trends and metrics between countries.
- Identify differences in pandemic impact and response.

### 6. Generate Insights
- Read the markdown explanations accompanying each analysis.
- Summarize key findings and interesting patterns discovered in the data.

### 7. Reproduce or Customize
- Modify filters or variables to analyze other countries or metrics.
- Extend the notebook with additional visualizations or analyses as desired.
